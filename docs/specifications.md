**tech_api** specifications sheet [template]
---------------------------------

This document defines everything about the API. It will be used as a reference
for the implementation/coding phase, but will also stay here as an in-depth
documentation of the system working principles.

The document is subdivided into various sections, representing various aspects
of the API.

_**(waiting to collect enough ideas and opinions to fill up this specs sheet)**_

## System architecture and basic concepts
*[introduction and things to know]*

## API interface with nodes
*[what functions are available, how callbacks are used, what information we pass
between the nodes and the system, etc...]*

## Power distribution algorithm
*[how we collect/distribute/store/move power given an energy network]*

## Performance notes
*[ideas, must-do s, tricks, notes, etc... for the performance of the implementation]*

## More...
*[more sections]*
